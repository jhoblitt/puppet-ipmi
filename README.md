Overview
--------

Manages the OpenIPMI package


Description
-----------

Installs the [OpemIPMI](http://openipmi.sourceforge.net/) package and enables
the `ipmi` service.  This loads the kernel drivers needed for communicating
with the BMC from user space.


Usage
-----

### Basic

    include ipmi

### All Params

    class { 'ipmi':
      service_ensure         => 'running', # default is 'running'
      ipmievd_service_ensure => 'running', # default is 'stopped'
   }


Limitations
-----------

At present, only support for `$::osfamily == 'RedHat'` has been implimented.
Adding other Linux distrubtions should be trivial.

### Tested on
