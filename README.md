Overview
--------

Manages IPMI


Description
-----------

Installs the [OpemIPMI](http://openipmi.sourceforge.net/) package and enables
the `ipmi` service.  This loads the kernel drivers needed for communicating
with the BMC from user space. Moreover, two facts are made available to the system.


Usage
-----

### Example

```puppet
    include ipmi
```

### Classes

#### `ipmi`

```puppet
# defaults
class { 'ipmi':
  service_ensure         => 'running', # default is 'running'
  ipmievd_service_ensure => 'running', # default is 'stopped'
  watchdog               => true,      # default is false
}
```

##### `service_ensure`

`String` defaults to: `running`

Possible values: `running`, `stopped`

Controls the state of the `ipmi` service.

##### `ipmievd_service_ensure`

`String` defaults to: `stopped`

Possible values: `running`, `stopped`

Controls the state of the `ipmievd` service.

##### `watchdog`

`Boolean` defaults to: `false`

Controls whether the IPMI watchdog is enabled.

### Facts

This module provides the following facts:

* kmod_isloaded_ipmi_si (Boolean) `true` if kernel module is loaded, `false` otherwise
* bmc_lan_conf (Hash) returns LAN configuration of BMC. Example: `{"IP_Address"=>"192.168.1.1", "Subnet_Mask"=>"255.255.255.0", "IP_Address_Source"=>"Static", "Default_Gateway_MAC_Address"=>"00:00:00:00:00:00", "Backup_Gateway_IP_Address"=>"0.0.0.0", "Backup_Gateway_MAC_Address"=>"00:00:00:00:00:00", "MAC_Address"=>"FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF", "Default_Gateway_IP_Address"=>"192.168.1.254"}`

Limitations
-----------

At present, only support for `$::osfamily == 'RedHat'` has been implimented.
Adding other Linux distrubtions should be trivial.

### Tested Platforms

* el5.x
* el6.x
* el7.x

### Puppet Version Compatibility

Versions | Puppet 2.7 | Puppet 3.x | Puppet 4.x
:--------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:
**1.x**  | **yes**    | **yes**    | no

Support
-------

Please log tickets and issues at
[github](https://github.com/jhoblitt/puppet-ipmi/issues)


Contributing
------------

1. Fork it on github
2. Make a local clone of your fork
3. Create a topic branch.  Eg, `feature/mousetrap`
4. Make/commit changes
    * Commit messages should be in [imperative tense](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html)
    * Check that linter warnings or errors are not introduced - `bundle exec rake lint`
    * Check that `Rspec-puppet` unit tests are not broken and coverage is added for new
      features - `bundle exec rake spec`
    * Documentation of API/features is updated as appropriate in the README
    * If present, `beaker` acceptance tests should be run and potentially
      updated - `bundle exec rake beaker`
5. When the feature is complete, rebase / squash the branch history as
   necessary to remove "fix typo", "oops", "whitespace" and other trivial commits
6. Push the topic branch to github
7. Open a Pull Request (PR) from the *topic branch* onto parent repo's `master` branch
